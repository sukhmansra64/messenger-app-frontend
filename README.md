# messenger-app-frontend
A full stack application used for communicating via text providing instant messaging. Made using MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJs, and SocketIO. Known bugs include saved messages not being saved in chat (kind of like snapchat), sometimes chats don't show up. (to get around this refresh the page and leave and rejoin the chatroom) This is the front-end of the app.
